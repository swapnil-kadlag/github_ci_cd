# What is CI/CD?

For the simplest definition, CI/CD is an acronym for three phases of software development:

- Continuous Integration
- Continuous Delivery
- and Continuous Deployment

## Continuous Integration (CI)

With continuous integration, developers work on their code in a local environment and commit their changes to a shared repository on a regular basis.

Their code can then be combined, or in other words integrated, with code from other members of the team or any existing code.

During the integration step, new code is tested and checked for any errors or any other requirements.

This can include linting the code for syntax errors and running unit tests on specific features.

The goal of CI is to allow teams to identify and resolve problems quickly and early in the development process.

## Continuous Delivery (CD)

Continuous delivery, follows the integration step.

After code has been integrated, the continuous delivery step automates the build process.

This step can also include additional testing at a higher level.  These tests might be more rigorous than unit tests and exercise multiple features at the same time.

By the end of this step, the software will be packaged and ready for release.

The goal of continuous delivery is to always have a version of the software that can be deployed into production as needed.

Which leads to the next CD: continuous deployment.

## Continuous Deployment (CD)

At its most fundamental level, continuous deployment places software in a production environment without human interaction.

In this case, the pipeline is fully automated with workflows using tests and validation to determine if the software is ready to be run in production.

Using a well defined continuous deployment pipeline, development teams can release software quickly and reliably, giving them more time to focus on feature development and other engineering tasks.
